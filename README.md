# üöÄ Real-time WebRTC Multi-Object Detection

A reproducible demo that performs real-time multi-object detection on a live video stream using WebRTC, on-device WASM inference, and a containerized architecture with Docker. This project was built as a solution for a technical interview task.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Video Streaming:** Uses WebRTC to create a direct peer-to-peer connection between a phone (streamer) and a browser (viewer).
* **On-Device AI:** Performs multi-object detection using an ONNX model running directly in the browser via WebAssembly (WASM).
* **Reproducible Environment:** Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose for a reliable one-command setup.
* **Client-Side Routing:** A simple and effective single-page application structure to handle both the viewer and streamer experiences.
